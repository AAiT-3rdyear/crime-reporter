**project discription**
   Crime-reporter application  help people to report  crimes  to the nearby police station by using their android phone . Crime activities can be theft, fighting, corruption acts and the like. The user can send his file in the form of photo, audio or video to the nearby police station. 

The reporting can be done anonymously or named so that the reporter will have full security. One can contribute to the development of the security of society because our app will provide a hassle-free and easy way for crime reporting. 

The reported crimes will be investigated and categorized by police stations and some notification message is forwarded for the reporter  indicating  whether the  crime he reported is solved or not


**business feautures**
  1.Users are able to take or upload criminal events to the nearby police station using our app. In doing this the user can take the picture or the video of the event from our app or he can upload previously recorded crime  from his file. 
  2. Police stations are able to categorize the reported crimes into pending,ongoing ,and solved crimes. And notify the reporter whether or not the crime he reported has solved or not. Police stations  also have  the ability to report the crime to the higher body if it is above their scope. 


**authorization feautures**
 We will have three  roles in our project: user(reporter) , police-stations (investigator) and admin.

  - User(reporter) has a role of recording and sending crime activities to the respected police station. User can't have access to the reported crimes unless he/she is given a role by the admin  
  - police-stations( investigators) has a role of accessing  the reported crimes and they can also have a role of reporting crime for another police stations 
  - Admin has full access to the  system users he also have an authority to assign a role for police-stations as investigators after validating whether that police station have specific legal authority
  - If user wants to have a role of police( investigator) first he/she must be registered as user then he/she should  have to send the required information for the admin to have a role as investigator Then the admin make the required validation and assign a role

**authentication feautures**
Both users(reporters) and police-stations need to register and log in to our system to access features that our system provides. and our system performs single factor authentication inorder to validate the users
