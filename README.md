**project discription**
   Crime-reporter application  help people to report  crimes  to the nearby police station by using their android phone . Crime activities can be theft, fighting, corruption acts and the like. The user can send his file in the form of photo, audio or video to the nearby police station. 

The crime reporter need to fill the required information needed  by the police station in order to report the crime. One can contribute to the development of the security of society because our app will provide a hassle-free and easy way for crime reporting. 

The reported crimes will be investigated and categorized by police stations and some notification message is forwarded for the reporter  indicating  whether the  crime he reported is solved or not


**business feautures**
  1.Users are able to report crime to nearby police station. In doing this the user can upload picture or the video of the crime  from his file.
  the user reports the crime by filling the form that includes the required information needed by the police station. 
  
  2. Police stations are able to categorize the reported crimes into pending,ongoing ,and solved crimes. And notify the reporter whether or not the crime he reported has been solved or not. Police stations  also have  the ability to report the crime to the higher body if it is above their scope. 


**authorization feautures**
 We will have three  roles in our project: user(reporter) , police-stations (investigator) and admin.

  - User(reporter) has a role of recording and sending crime activities to nearby police station . User can't have access to the reported crimes unless he/she is given a role by the admin  
  - police-stations( investigators) has a role of accessing  the reported crimes and they can also have a role of reporting crime for another police stations 
  - Admin has full access to the  system users he also have an authority to register police-stations as investigators after validating whether that police station have specific legal authority

**authentication feautures**
- Both users(reporters) need to register and log in to our system to access features that our system provides. and our system performs single factor authentication inorder to validate the users
- users are also able to log out of the system easily.they are also able to edit their accout(change username and password) or delete their account
